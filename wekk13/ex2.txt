Avoidanse
Deadlock avoidance merely works to avoid deadlock; it does not totally prevent it.
The basic idea is to allocate resources only if the resulting global state is a safe state.
Since resource allocation is not done right away in some cases, deadlock avoidance algorithms also suffer from low resource utilization problem.
Prevention
Deadlock prevention algorithms ensure that at least one of the necessary conditions (Mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption and circular wait) does not hold true. 
However most prevention algorithms have poor resource utilization, and hence result in reduced throughputs.
Recovery
Traditional operating system doesn’t deal with deadlock recovery as it is time and space consuming process. 
Real time operating systems use Deadlock recovery.
